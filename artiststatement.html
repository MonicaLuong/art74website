                    Obviously everyone creates art for a reason, possibly a reason that they are unaware of. I believe that I create art for the latter and am on the quest to find what makes me think. Art that I make is typically whatever I am thinking about such as stress or the wall in front of me. In a simple way, the reason I create art is to explain my feelings to myself, then expand in a way to explain to others. I like to think I create art that is both straightforward but strangely complicated like a rubix cube, a simple thought can change the angle of the thought. I enjoy mixed media because I then have no limitations of what I can make. I don’t have to force a material to mimic an existing material that can take its place.

Materials are very important to subject matter because only certain materials can give the feeling you want to convey. When you have a complicated subject matter, such as mine, different materials are necessary to explain different ideas. With my art, I hope that I can tell others what I feel and possibly understand how they relate or don’t. I feel that my artwork is very like is my personality because typically with people I try not to talk necessarily, truthfully harsh, and odd. In the end, I feel that my art is an extension of myself, attempting to work a different angle to figure out or draw out hidden similar feelings in others.
